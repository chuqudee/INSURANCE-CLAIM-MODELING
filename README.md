# Insurance Claims Modeling

## Project description

- ### Project Overview: Insurance Claims

The aim of this project is to predict the average claim amount per exposure, for specific risk profiles.    
A risk profile describes a policyholder (someone who is a client and owns a policy at the insurer), things like age, gender, marital status, etc. 
These attributes can all be found in the dataset used in this project. The reason for doing this is so that the predicted claim can be used to calculate a premium for new applicants, based on their predicted risk. 
This way the insurer maximises profits by charging higher premiums for higher risk profiles. 
It is important to consider however that accompanying a higher premium, the insurer should maintain sensibility in deciding on a premium and still outcompete competitor insurers, which make business rules essential.
